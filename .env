The tech strategy should address the following aspects:\n    - Market analysis: Identify the current and potential market opportunities and threats for Zephyr in different regions and segments. Evaluate the customer needs, preferences, and behaviors, as well as the competitive landscape and regulatory environment.\n    - Technology assessment: Assess the current and future technology trends and developments that are relevant for Zephyr’s industry and domain. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of Zephyr’s existing technology portfolio and capabilities, as well as the gaps and risks that need to be addressed.\n    - Technology roadmap: Define the strategic vision and goals for Zephyr’s technology development and innovation. Prioritize the key technology initiatives and projects that can deliver the most value and impact for Zephyr. Outline the timeline, budget, resources, and milestones for each initiative and project.\n    - Technology governance: Establish the governance framework and processes for Zephyr’s technology management and decision-making.

Establish the performance indicators and evaluation methods for measuring the progress and outcomes of the technology strategy.\n- **Tasks and responsibilities**: The tasks and responsibilities of the tech strategy consulting project are divided into four phases:\n    - Phase 1: Data collection and analysis. In this phase, the consulting team will gather and analyze the relevant data and information from various sources, such as Zephyr’s internal documents and reports, external market research and industry reports, customer surveys and interviews, competitor analysis, and technology trend analysis. The consulting team will also conduct site visits and observations of Zephyr’s operations and facilities, as well as benchmarking and best practices analysis of other leading companies in the wind energy and turbine technology sector. The output of this phase will be a comprehensive and detailed market and technology assessment report that will provide the basis for the subsequent phases.\n    - Phase 2: Strategy formulation and validation. In this phase, the consulting team will use the findings and insights from the market and technology assessment report to formulate the tech strategy for Zephyr. The consulting team will apply various tools and frameworks, such as SWOT analysis, Porter’s five forces analysis, value proposition canvas, business model canvas, and technology S-curve analysis, to define the strategic vision and goals, identify the key technology initiatives and projects, and prioritize them according to their value and feasibility. The consulting team will also validate the tech strategy with Zephyr’s senior management and key stakeholders, as well as solicit feedback and input from the relevant experts and partners. The output of this phase will be a draft tech strategy document that will outline the main elements and recommendations of the tech strategy.\n    - Phase 3: Strategy refinement and presentation. In this phase, the consulting team will refine and finalize the tech strategy document based on the feedback and input from Zephyr and other parties. The consulting team will also prepare a presentation that will summarize and highlight the key points and benefits of the tech strategy, as well as the implementation plan and roadmap. The consulting team will present the tech strategy to Zephyr’s senior management and board of directors, as well as other relevant stakeholders and audiences, such as investors, customers, and media.
